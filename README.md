# My Personal Project: Personal Finance Tracker
___
## Background
___

The purpose of this application is to provide users a **tool to track their income and expenses** so they have a **clear 
overview of their financial situation**. This will increase financial awareness and allow the user to make informed decisions 
about their finances. This application can be used by *anyone* who wants to manage their personal finances.

After obtaining the user's income, budgets, and savings goal, the application will keep track of progress made towards the
specified savings goal in real time as the user inputs their daily expenses or earnings. It will also notify the user if 
they are approaching or have surpassed their budget.

*Why?*

This project was of interest to me because as a university student, I tend to struggle with managing my personal 
finances. There are a lot of untracked expenses that make me go over my budget, preventing me from saving money. 
With this application, I hope to make the process of personal finance tracking more transparent and easier to manage.
