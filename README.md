# Personal Finance Tracker
___
## Background
___

The purpose of this application is to provide users a **tool to track their earnings and expenses** so they have a **clear 
overview of their financial situation**. This will increase financial awareness and allow the user to make informed decisions 
about their finances. This application can be used by *anyone* who wants to manage their personal finances.

This application will allow users to log and see all their expenses and earnings. Expenses will be flagged by a category
such as "groceries"; this will allow the user to see their total spending per category.

*Why?*

This project was of interest to me because as a university student, I tend to struggle with managing my personal 
finances. There are a lot of untracked expenses that make me unnecessarily overspend in categories such as shopping or entertainment. 
With this application, I hope to make the process of personal finance tracking more transparent and easier to manage.
